#Theory :-



# From the plot it seems like the butter can be used as cross-selling with other products, it also acts as something to be offered with antecedents that is low. Thus, the customers are more likely to buy them if the butter are offered with cheaper price if they buy the antecedents that sold less in a store

# The sale transaction or count for each unique item approximately for this sample. We will dive into and see whether there is any difference or correlation between the baskets. Since the dataframe is already tabulated one hot data frame, we will straight away and use the dataset to be analyzed with apriori
# ## Apriori Algorithm
# Little bit background introduction for `Apriori Algorithm`. The algorithm assumes that any subset of a frequent itemset must be frequent. Say in our cases, where {apple, unicorn, yoghurt} is frequent then {apple,yoghurt} is frequent. Whereas {apple,unicorn} is not frequent, then {apple,unicorn,yoghurt} is not frequent.
# 
# __SUPPORT__ =  A simple way to control complexity is to place a constraint that such rules must apply to some minimum percentage of the data <br>
# __CONFIDENCE__ =  The probability that B occurs when A; it is p(B|A), which in association mining.<br>
# __LIFT__ =  the co-occurrence of A and B is the probability that we actually see the two together, compared to the probability that we would see the two together if they were unrelated to (independent of) each other.<br>
# __LEVERAGE__ =  alternative is to look at the difference between these quantities rather than their ratio.<br>
# __CONVICTION__ = measure to ascertain the direction of the rule. Unlike lift, conviction is sensitive to the rule direction.
# 
# Just Support and Confidence as a parameter might be misleading for items that are too common/ popular in the basket. It is more likely that popular items are part of the same basket just because they are popular rather than anything else. 

# # What is Apriori Algorithm?
# Apriori Algorithm is one of the algorithm used for transaction data in Association Rule Learning. It allows us to mine the frequent itemset in order to generate association rule between them.
# Example: list of items purchased by customers, details of website which are frequently visited etc.
# 
# This algorithm was introduced by Agrawal and Srikant in 1994.
# 
# Principles behind Apriori Algorithm
# 
# Subset of frequent itemset are frequent itemset.
# Superset of infrequent itemset are infrequent itemset.
# I know you are wondering this is too technical but donâ€™t worry you will get it once we see how it works!
# 
# Apriori Algorithm has three parts:
# 1. Support
# 2. Confidence
# 3. Lift
# 
# Support( I )=
# ( Number of transactions containing item I ) / ( Total number of transactions )
# 
# Confidence( I1 -> I2 ) =
# ( Number of transactions containing I1 and I2 ) / ( Number of transactions containing I1 )
# 
# Lift( I1 -> I2 ) = ( Confidence( I1 -> I2 ) / ( Support(I2) )
# 
# 
# Association Rule Learning is a data mining technique which allows us to get interesting insights of relationship among the items.
